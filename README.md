# YoloObj
Python script for object recognition using YoloV2, openCV, and Tensorflow.
Please note: this program was not playing nice with Python3.7. I was able to run it with Python3.6.7.
Also, weights and cfg's are needed for object detection and can be downloaded at: https://pjreddie.com/darknet
So far, I have only been able to get YoloV2 weight and YoloV2 CFG to compile together.
